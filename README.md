## Recent Improvements - No Automatic Downloads
We've fixed an issue where the application was automatically downloading JSON files during page refresh and initialization. Now:

- **No Automatic Downloads**: The application no longer triggers unwanted file downloads during normal operation
- **Controlled Exports**: File downloads only happen when explicitly requested by the user
- **Data Persistence**: All data is still properly saved to localStorage for persistence
- **Export Functionality**: Export to JSON/CSV still works as expected when requested

## Additional Fixes
We've also fixed several other issues:

- **Fixed Error Loading Preview**: Resolved issues with example files preview in the info page modal
- **Fixed Missing Categories**: Categories now properly load in transaction filters and the add transaction page
- **Improved Error Handling**: Better error messages and handling for file operations

### How It Works
1. **Data Storage**: All data is stored in the browser's localStorage for persistence
2. **File Operations**: File downloads only occur when explicitly requested through the export functionality
3. **Initialization**: The app initializes without triggering any downloads
4. **Normal Operations**: Adding, editing, or deleting data doesn't trigger downloads

### Export Options
- Export individual data types (Accounts, Transactions, Budgets, Categories, Settings)
- Export in JSON format for complete data structure
- Export in CSV format for spreadsheet compatibility
- Export all data at once

### Import Options
- Import data from JSON files
- Import data from CSV files
- View example files to understand the expected format
